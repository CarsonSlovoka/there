# there
`there`, also called `GoThere`, aims to be a simple Go Library to reduce redundant code for REST APIs. The name `GoThere` because it tells the incoming requests to "go there".
With `there` it is a delight to create a REST API. You can focus on writing your API without writing boilerplate and duplicate code. Just start coding and save time!
